- Google keynote

- new and awesome
  - multi window mode
    - can have multiple activities up
  - drag and drop between activities
  - notifications
    - also bundled notifications
    - direct reply in notification
  - quick settings
    - can also create own settings tile in your app
  - diaply size
    - everything gets bigger, navbar as well, not just font
  - project svelte
  - data saver
    - limit data usage on per application basis
  - scoped riectory access permission
  - android for work
    - good way to turn off apps for the weekend
    - can also make work apps moe secure, extra password, than the lock screen
  - vulkan
    - low overhead 3d api
  -
  
- android studio
  - new 2.0
    - instant run, swap code in real time
    - lot faster
  - 2.1
    - n developer previw
  - 2.2
    - still faster
    - android platform supprt
    - more firebase integration
  - emulators
    - 3x faster
    - faster than device
    - also build with instant run
      - how instant run work
        - hot swap: pointer to new bin changed
        - warm swap: when
        - cold swap: restart all app (inherirance changes)
  - new layout editor
    - no longer required to go into xml
    
- Firebase
  - development
    - realtime database
    - authentication
    - hosting, static file assets, ssl encrypted by default
    - storage, google cloud storage
    - cloud messaging, cross platform messaging solution
    - remote config: put app config vars intot he cloud; can modify app withotu redeploying
    - test lab for android
    - crash reporting
  - to grow user base
    - invites
    - dynamic links, single url to manage installation and provide deep links into app contents
    - google adwords
    - app indexing: gets app into google search
    - notifications: targetted user notifications
  - earn
    - admob:
    
- machine learning
  - tensor flow (tensorflow.org)
    - face detector for face landmarks
    - expecially good for deep learning
    - deep query
    - supprt for android
  - steps for ml example
    - get data set, 'mnist' data set
    - split 90% traning data, 10% test data
    - pick stats model, classigier
      - linear classifier (LinearClassifer) picked, so 28x28 image becomes a 784 array
      - assign a weight for each 784 postions
        - start with random weights
        - as learn, weights will change -> learning of the weights
          - this is done by the fit method
            - uses gradient descent
            - back propagaion algorithm
    - train classifer, then test and eevaluate
      - got 92% accuracy
      - can gtet better accuracy with DNNNClassifier (deep neural networ classifier)
    - to pick this up
      - tensorflow.org
      - start with tensor flow for poets
      - then go to tensor flow for android
      
  - gcp
    - ml models for speech, vision, translation
      - label detection, face detection ocr, landmark detection, logo detection, exhibit content detection
