- firebase test labs
  - logs, screenshots, performance
  - espresso and UIAutomator instumented tests
  
- firebase crash reporting

- firebase crashlytics
  - primary crash reporter for firebase
  - firebase performance monitoring
    
- google analytics for firebase
  - designed for mobile apps
  - event and user centric
  - connects across firebase
  - free and unlimited
  - has concept of audience; grouped by how they use their app
    - group users by behavior
  - look at
    - streamview, see what people doing in apps in real time, anonymous
    - debug view, debug what is appening on an actual app
    
- bigquery integration

- firebase cloud messaging
  - psh notifications, cross platform messaging solution

  - take analytics adat and applying ML to it
    - segments into grouops
    
- google adwords
  - place ad in search results for your app
  
- admob by google
  - plkace ads in your app
  - integrated with firebazse sdk

20171202 - android things, sentinel home security robot
- why
  - have roaming camera in the house
  
- parts - $180 total cost
  - rover 5 platform, $35
  - raspberry pi 3, 32gb - sd card with anddroid things
  - adafruit DC and stepper motor
    - HAT for RPi
  - adafruit 16-channel PWM
    - Servo HAT for rPi
  - Raspberry Pi camera
  - pan/tilt bracket
  - 3d printed camera mount
  
- how
  - alerts are through firebase mesaging
  - photos go to google cloud
  - sends commad to firebase, then robot down,oads commands from firebase and executes
  - google function to take high quality image and shrink to thumbnail
  
- tinyLIDAR
  - use to follow hand
  - look for youtube video

2171202 - andorid things
- differences between android and nadroid things
  - no play store
    - here you ship the device and software
  - subset of APIs
    - no contacts, messaging, system ui, wallpaers
    - but added i/o, dev management, user drivers, connectivity (Things Support Library)
    
  - custom hardware
  - single purpose device
  - no updates, deploy OTAs
  
- how
  - deveop on bigger board than deployment board
    - dev board might have ethernet port
  - hardware
    - NPX or raspberry pi
  - hardware integration
    - peripheral driver library - github
      - bit.ly/androidthings-github      
    - pripheral I/O - low level access
    
- distribution
  - managed by google
    - android framework, hardware livbs, linux
  - manager by devs
    - apps, your app

- adndorid things console
  - mange your android things iOT product
  download and install latest and iot image
  - build factory images that contain oem
  - push over the airs OTAs
  
- info
  - signed images
  - verified bot
  - A/B rollback protection
  - automatic security updates
  
- example, build a motion sensing camera
  - use android studio
    - check android things box at end, uncheck pheone/tablet

20171202 - cancer screening with tensor floe
- josh gordon, @random_forests

- keras ML
- approach for TF
  - use sliding pixel box
  - box is 299x299 pixels
  - how physicisans/pathologists use
    - zoom out, then zoom in, then zoom out
    - do same zoom in/out for the same 299x299 box
    - trained 4 different networks
      - 40x, 20x, 10x, 5x
      - prediction on centers 128x128 of original 40x input
      
- tips
  - when training model, randomize the data
  - problems with rotation
    - apply augmentations to it for training data
     - colors, rotate by random degrees, contrast
  - use multiple holdout sets
    - collected by different institutions
  - generate actionalble insights
  - datadet size >> tuning model
  - data gains are worth more than model gains
    - model tweaking ~ 3%

- 90% of ML is surervised
  - because it works well, it's more mature
  
- 8 weeks to train on 8 gpus
    
- how to learn more
  - accessible books
  
    - deep learning with pythin, chollet
    - hands on deep leartning with scikit learn and TF, geron
    - python machine learning
  - videos
    - ML  recipes
  - web

    - research.googleblog.com/2017/03/assisting-pathologists-in-detecting.html
    
- diabetes
  - study diabetest
  - swelling blood vessels, indi ate early onset blindness
  - earlietr diagnosis can help prevent disease
  - try to provide free 2nd opinion
  - how
    - conv network, 26 layers
  - dataset train/test splits
    dev
      - 80% train, 20 tune
        - 
      - 130k images
      
- look up
  - inception, other image classifier
    - low parameetrs, high accuracy
  - look at image classifier models in TF
  - tensorflow research cloud
  - cpus vs gps
    - cpu good at if/else, gpu good at matrix
