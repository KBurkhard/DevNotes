20171202 - cancer screening with tensor floe
- keras ML
- approach for TF
  - use sliding pixel box
  - box is 299x299 pixels
  - how physicisans/pathologists use
    - zoom out, then zoom in, then zoom out
    - do same zoom in/out for the same 299x299 box
    - trained 4 different networks
      - 40x, 20x, 10x, 5x
      - prediction on centers 128x128 of original 40x input
      
- tips
  - when training model, randomize the data
  - problems with rotation
    - apply augmentations to it for training data
     - colors, rotate by random degrees, contrast
  - use multiple holdout sets
    - collected by different institutions
  - generate actionalble insights
  - datadet size >> tuning model
  - data gains are worth more than model gains
    - model tweaking ~ 3%
    
      
- diabetes
  - study diabetest
  - swelling blood vessels, indi ate early onset blindness
  - earlietr diagnosis can help prevent disease
  - try to provide free 2nd opinion
  - how
    - conv network, 26 layers
    
  - dataset train/test splits
    dev
      - 80% train, 20 tune
        - 
      - 130k images
      
- look up
  - inception, other image classifier
    - low parameetrs, high accuracy
  - look at image classifier models in TF
