Ntes:

- chpter 6, resource and qualifiers
 - to enable different layput depending on orientation
   - layout, layout-land
   - docs: https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources.html
     - for qualifiers, can also chain the together
     - layout-hdpi-fr
     - nut there is no tablet/phone qualifier
     
- chaptr 7, activities
  - adb, android debugging bridge
  - am, activity manager
  -
  
- misc
  - apps are stopped by android directly, code has no way to do this
  - views will now \quickly write out their data when orientation change happens before activity is recreated
    - we coly have to do this ourselves if we created a new type of viw
  - android does not support RMI or jdbc clients
  - fragments
    - activity manages fragments, and gfragments manage the UI
    - ragments only useful if you're going to reuse them throughout multiple activities
    - but fragments have a more complicated lifecycle
      - so some trade offs
      
- gradle tricks
  - org.gradle.parrallel=true setting
  - org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx2014m -XX:MaxPermSize=512m -XX:+HeapDumpPnOutOfMemoryError
  
- in android device
  - does not run java byte code in device
  - it gets converted to davlik, using dex byte code
  
- proguard
  - removes librarues that it deems not used by the application
  - does change byte code, so new apk has to be fully retested
  - sometimes there are libs that are removed by mistake
    - especially if using reflection
  - free software; there is also androidguard which is paid
  

- sql lite database
  - look at lab 9.3
