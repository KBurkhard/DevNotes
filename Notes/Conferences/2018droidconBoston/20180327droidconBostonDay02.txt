- alice yuan, company: pinterest, github.com/AliceYuan
- issues
  - protected vars View in abstract class
    - issue as they grow is that they can modified by any inheriting class
    - also inheritence hell
    - solve with inheritance vs comlposition
    



20180327 - REST security
- potentil issues
  - GET calls with exposed params, using non encrypted http (not https), so human readable
  - application saving username/password on cell phone in plain text
    - issues: plain text, on device
    - fix: use shared preference in private mode, so only accessible by your app
      - tetString()
      - also open files in private mode
    - fix: AndroidKeyStore
      - java cryptography implementation
      
  - OAUTH
  - json web token
    - combined with json web signature
    - JWT + JWS (json web token + json web signature)
      - can have limited tokens
      - JWT can heps with:
        - authenticatyion
        - authorization
        - federated identity
        - information exchange
        - client side sessions (stateless sessions)
        - client side secrest
       
  - firebase auth
    - federated auth providers
    - passwordless login
    - anonymous authentication
    - mangement
    
  
- good practices
  - use mCAPTCHA
    - can use in androd to make sure rest endpoint doesn't respond to robots
    - since android app generates the captcha with the key you have, then can be verifies by REST service
