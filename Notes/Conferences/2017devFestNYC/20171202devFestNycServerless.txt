- thewebivore.com
  - soft eng lead on iopipe
  - GDE
  - Turing-Incomplete podcast
  
- biggest deal in cloud computing right now
  - can get 5 million request for $5
  - over how long? doesn't matter
  - NoOPs environemnt
  - allows you to focus on biz problems,
  
- Faas
  - function as a service
  - run code based on trigger
  - came out late 2015
  - what
    - small building blocks (functions)
    - auto scaling
    - pay per usage
    - availability and faut tolerance
  - pricing
    - cost = compute time + invocations + network
  - providers
    - aws lambda
      - languages: go, java, nodejs, python
      - aws will now charge by the second (probably due to serverless)
      - architectures
        - exec time 5 lmins
        - if too much mem, function killed
        - /tmp disk space
        - request body limits
      - can set concurrency limits on individual Lambdas
      - CloudTrail for Lambda activity
      - serverless Aurora
    - google cloud functions
      - only nodejs
    - azure
    - apache openwhisk
      - run your own NoOps infrastrucure
  - deploying
    - upload the code (50mb limit on lambda)
  - tips
    - cold start will slower, since the code is loaded into a cold container
      - JS load is faster than Java
    
- Baas
  - back end as a service
  - relying on other services for your back end needs
  
- how serverless is impating industry
  - achitectures
  - you must integrate operations into your development model
  - managing state
  - testing, netwrking
  -
