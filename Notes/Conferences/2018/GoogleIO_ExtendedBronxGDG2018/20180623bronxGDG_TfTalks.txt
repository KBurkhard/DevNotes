20180623 - TF workshop
- dataset
- deep neural netwroks
- making informaed decisions based on data
-

- scott model
  - 20k iterations, needed 3 hours to run
  - 99.13% accuracy
  - 3 layer network
  
  
- image recognotion
  - 28x28 pixels -> 7084 cells
  -
- notes
  - if your data is bad, your model will be terrib;e
  - want some errors in your model
  - should have 99% accurac
  
  
  - fully connected network
    - each node is connected
  - hidden layers
    - layers between input and output layers
  - each layer has bas added in
  
  - hoe to prune node
    - if nodes are getting small weights, then prune it out
  - neural netwroks are heavy to train
  - to view hidden laers when taining
    - tensorboard
  - if only gong to use one lyer, don't use tf
  
  - book: ML with scikit
