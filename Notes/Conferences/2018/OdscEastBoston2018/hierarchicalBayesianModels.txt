- eaxmapl
  - gas prices in the country
  - clusters of prices and usages
    - so build a model specific to region, but still combine somehow
    
- bayesian model
  - comvbines prior beliefe with the data we observe
  - posterior beliefe = prior belief <tempered> by evidence
  
- bayesian regression model
  - assume y = alpha + beta * x
  - priors:
    - alpha is normal(1, 10)
    - beta is normal(1, 5)
  - also assume y has normal distribution (from regression)
  
-
  - use pymc3 library for python
  
- for airport example
  - do we use seperate models for each airport or use one for all
  - cal assume the distributions fo the alpha and beta is imilar
    - so prio distros will be similar
    
- for price product quantity mode
- delta Q = alpha + beta * delta P + epsilon
  - epsilon is intercept
  


- notes from example
  - find_MAP -> gives a point estimation
