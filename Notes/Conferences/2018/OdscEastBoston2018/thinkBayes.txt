- bayes theorem
  - P( a | b) = probably that a occurs giben that b occured
  
- in example, P(D) is

- cookie bowl problem
  - prob vanilla cookie came from bowl 1 = prob prior data * prob get valilla from bowl 1 / prob of getting vanilla from all bowls
  - p(H | D) = p(H) * p(D | H) / p(D)
  
- 2 dice example
  - even distro per dice of 1-6
  - roll 2, sum most likely 7
  - if postulate that 2,3 are nt pooutcomes
    - then renoralize and get new distribution goven extra outcome data
    
    
- tank problem
  - german tank factory can produce 1-100 tanks
    - if capture tank serial #37, what is the lilelyhood of how many tanks were produced
    - if after that, capture tank 17
      - it updates distro because it makes it more liely that they only produced 37 every time you catch a tank < 37
  - lookk at wikipedia pagee on german tank problem
  
  
- for normal distro
  - as it ets narrower, just means you have better confidence in the peak result

- MAP
  - maximum a posteriry peak
- posterior credible interval
  - chance that fall into the 90% interval
  
  
- conclusison
  - big methods next
    - markov chains monte carlo distributions
      -> next thing to learn
  - can also star with grid methods
    - if can solve problem great, or else look at monte carlo
