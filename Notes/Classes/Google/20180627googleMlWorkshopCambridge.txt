- will koffel
    - used to be mobile first
      - now startus are AI first
  
- yufeng guo
  - goog transoomred into AI company
  - democratize ai -> fast, useful, accessible
    - ml apis
      - pre trained ML models; no data to suply for training (no training on your end)
        - model apis
          - translate, speech,, natural language, video intelligence, vision, cloud jobs api
        - descriptions
            - image apis
              - label detection
              - get entity id, can get data back from goole through api
            - video api
              - understand content, makes sense of large video files
            - recomend content
        - these model are built from building blocks
          - fully traine models
          - more to come
          
    - cloud autoML (customize models to your data)
        - how to train your own mkdels easily
          - right now just for vision
          - trued different approachees of the model on its own
            - will use ML to updatr the structure of the model
            - 'learning to leanr' paper
            - ' neural arch search with enforcement leaning' paper
            
    - ML engine (use TF on your own)
      - some models are bigger than UG's graphics cad memory footprint
      - data
        - image recog 40x faster with 50 gps
        - search ranking 300x faster with 500 nodes
      - TPU
        - 4 chips on board
        - 2 cores per chip
        - each core fed by 8 gigs memory
        - can put 64 tpus per pod
        - top end of machine -> redeuce training from 9 hrs to 30 mins
      - cloud ML engine is a fully managed platform for TF
        - distribured trainng with gpus and tpus
        - yper param tuning with HyperTue
        - could.google.com/ml-engine
      - supports for sklearn and xgboost libs

- joe lust (mabl co employee)
  - on gcp and why they moved to it; cloud native since 2011
  - continuous delivery broken by qa
    - continuous deloivery breaks qa
    - slow release process; might change everything every quarter
  - go predermined script testing (selenium) to automatic healing of testing
  - the ML @ mabl
    - anomily detection
      - timing anomalies (request reesponse), visual change anomalies (button change, page layout - css errors)
  - enter you we site address, and testing takes over on the cloud
  - runs tests in GCP pipelines; products used:
    - Pub/Sub -> managed Kafka
    - Biquery
    - cloud ML engine
    - GCS
    - DataFlow
    - Datastore
  - mabl cloud design tenets
    - serverless
      - no provisioning, transparent scaling, event driven, pay only for use
        - docker and kubernetes (massive scale, 10e6 containers a month - 10e12 for google)
    - decouple systems
      - message passing, polyglot develoment, independent deployment, minimize blast radius from one piece getting broken
    - event driven as much as possible
      - no cron jobs or batch processes, continuous pipleines, surge buffer, 100s me to 1-2s handling
      - GCP products used: cloud functions, cloud datafloe
  - went from 0 to alpha product in 6 months, with 8 devs
    - if use the pattersn used in GCP, using the best patterns for scale
    - little dread of have to re write the system
    - gcp produts work well together

  - gcp
  
- questions
  - auto ML -> is the structure update include the layer structure (numbers, breadth)
