- will koffel
    - used to be mobile first
      - now startus are AI first
  
- yufeng guo
  - goog transoomred into AI company
  - democratize ai -> fast, useful, accessible
    - ml apis
      - pre trained ML models; no data to suply for training (no training on your end)
        - model apis
          - translate, speech,, natural language, video intelligence, vision, cloud jobs api
        - descriptions
            - image apis
              - label detection
              - get entity id, can get data back from goole through api
            - video api
              - understand content, makes sense of large video files
            - recomend content
        - these model are built from building blocks
          - fully traine models
          - more to come
          
    - cloud autoML (customize models to your data)
        - how to train your own mkdels easily
          - right now just for vision
          - trued different approachees of the model on its own
            - will use ML to updatr the structure of the model
            - 'learning to leanr' paper
            - ' neural arch search with enforcement leaning' paper
            
    - ML engine (use TF on your own)
      - some models are bigger than UG's graphics cad memory footprint
      - data
        - image recog 40x faster with 50 gps
        - search ranking 300x faster with 500 nodes
      - TPU
        - 4 chips on board
        - 2 cores per chip
        - each core fed by 8 gigs memory
        - can put 64 tpus per pod
        - top end of machine -> redeuce training from 9 hrs to 30 mins
      - cloud ML engine is a fully managed platform for TF
        - distribured trainng with gpus and tpus
        - yper param tuning with HyperTue
        - could.google.com/ml-engine
      - supports for sklearn and xgboost libs

- questions
  - auto ML -> is the structure update include the layer structure (numbers, breadth)
