- jay jenkins, natalie piucco


20171205 - crash caourse in GCP machine mearning APIs
- giphy
- image stored in box, will do vision AI detection
- cloud video intelligence
  - label detection
  shot change detection
  - explicit content detection
  
- speech
  - can get sentimemnt value for all text
    - can also do entity based sentiment
    
    
20171205 - TF
- john barrus, zak stone
- estimator and layer API


201712206 - TF
- yufeng guo
- use census data
- wide and deep columns
  - dnnLinearCombinedClassifier
- https://github.com/yufengg/widendeep

- pandas input functions built into tf
- pandas columns to analyze data
- turn age to age buckets
- dnn_hidden_units = [100, 75, 50, 25]
  - 4 layers, with 100 neurons, 75, ect
  
- nm_epochs -> umber of passes of data
  - shuffle false since go through only once
  
- can train on laptopm, then predict

20171206 - ML lifecycle
- dinesh kulkami

- for preparing the data, figure out range, translate day into day of week, time into rush hour or not, etc
- tensor board to keep track of tf

- used 15 of data to quickly test model 
- steps
  - explore -> prepare -> preprocess -> train -> hypertune -> evaluate -> predict
    - hypertune: have tool to let you loop through model parameter

- commans
  - ml evaluate regression
  - ml explain
    - helps you see what your ml data is using to train itself
    - can determine bias
      - ex: snow in wolf images vs no snow for dog images
        - then make sure get dog in snow images
