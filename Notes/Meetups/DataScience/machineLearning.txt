20180416 - ML on edge devices like phones

- open data
  - imagenet, cifar

- steps
  - get data
  - train matches to production
    - can augment your model by duplicating images and rotate them
    - can also update lighting
  - input sizes
    - berae large inputs
    - explicit dimensions
    -
  - collect input/output samplig
    - cache model inputs and outputs
      - buffer size
        - look out for network bandwidth
      - sampling rate
        - just get a few frames per second for video
      - device characteristics
    - send back to cloud
      - connectivity
      - bandwidth limitations
      
  - train
    - make sure trai ing env matches production
      - use numpi and pandas to massage data
  - optimize -> google papaer for mobile nets, optimized formobile devices
    - architecture
      - depthwise separable convolutions
      - hardware aware design
      - architecture search
    - prning
      - mobile nets width mutiplier (threw away a fractio of params)
      - also steps
        - compute importamce of features (can see how much they contribute to the model)
        - prune
        - rewire
        - fine tune
    - compression
      - quantization
        - all the weight in CNN are floating point (and rather large)
          - can convert them to 8 bit integer
          - so bin weights in 256 bins
            - will degrade the performance
            - can simulate the compression in your trauining step
      - serialization
    - iterative process
      - generate arch
      - ttrain network
      - benchmark performance
      - minimize cost
      
    - convert
      - tools to convert from server side models to mobile ones
        - TOCO< tf-coreml, ONNX,
        
    - protection of model on mobile device
      - encryption
      - obfuscation
        - add proprietary firs step (rotate all images 90 degrees)
        - scramble weights, unscramble at run time
    
    - deploy
      - port pre and post processing
      - pre loaded vs fetch at runtime
      - models are features
        - versioning
        - staged rollouts
      - put the right model on the right device
      
    - monitor
      - metrics for mobile
        - runtime
        - memory
        - battery drain
        - usage
        
    
- frameworks
  - kerrs
  - tf
  - for devices
    - core ml
    - tf lite
    - windows ml
    - caffe2go
    - TuriCreate
    - IBM watson studio
      - can export to core ml
    - Azure custom vision
      - can export to core ml
    
- products
  - Fritz AI tools
  - fritz.ai
  
- misc
  - siri has its own chip
  - gartner redicts 20% of pphones have ML chips by 2020
  - commun ity: heartbeat
  - tools: alchemy
  
  -ssd
    - single shot detection
    - look at mobilenet
    - single image, determines objects in image through bounding boxes
    
  
- numpi and pandas to massage data before model
