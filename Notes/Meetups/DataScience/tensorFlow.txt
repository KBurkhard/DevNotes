20180430 - gdg boston tensor flow

- future meetups
  - may, google i/o recap
  - june, flutter code lab
    - flutter is cross platform multi language env
  - july, gcp study group
  
  
- talks
- praveen, ncaa TF bracket
  - input features
    - ppg avg, ppa avg, reg season wins, num ber of 3s, turnovrs, pg, assists per g, conf champ (binary),
        seed, strength of sched, rebs per game, steals per game, time of game, tv game (binary), number ncaa appearances last 30 years
    - create vector with values
      - approach
        - one vector for each team, then do diff between vectors
        - use last 25 years of all games and train model
        - used gradient boosted regression test algorithm
    - github/aravamudham/ncaa-2018-ML
  - tech
    - tf
    - numpy
    
- modeling chemical structures using deep learning
  - ankit gupta
  - goal
    - design a ligand to bind to a protein to inhibit the protein
  - why hard
    - proteins are large
      - may need to model 100s of atoms
    - good data is scarce
    - molecular interactions are hard to model precisely
    - pother props
      - solubility
      - lipophilicity
      - liver clearance
      - cell membrane permeability
    - use ML
      - model molecular props
      - reduce time cost
    - options of data to use
      - 1d fingerprimt f featurization
      - 3d dense grid featurization (charge density cloud)
      -
    - approach
      - use MPNN
        - treat moecue as grah

- notes
  - get baseball data from mccaggle (ml site)
  - ibm quantum compting hackathon
  - baseball hack day hackathon
  - if have a lot of features and small training set, more likely to overfit
