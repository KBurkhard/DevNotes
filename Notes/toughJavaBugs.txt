  - mysqldb wasn't loading, so caught exception lead to empty list
  

20170221 - had TreeSet trim given list of Property objects from 28 to 10
- error
  - was using comparator in TreeSet constructor that had compareTo() method that compared on name if same property type (common vs sg property)
  - HashSet didn't have this issue
- fix
  - compare on getId() of property instead
  - does not sort by data set, through, but not needed
